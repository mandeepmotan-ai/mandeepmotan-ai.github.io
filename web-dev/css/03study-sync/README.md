# 🌐 First HTML & CSS Project  

This is my **first project after completing the basics of HTML & CSS and being a bit confident with them** 🎉  
The main goal of this project is to practice **page layout, styling, and responsive design**.  

👉 **Note**: I’ve tried to make it responsive, but at this stage I am still learning to make responsive design  
For the best experience, please view it on **PC/Desktop** 💻
